# Project Name : Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## Problem statement : 
With the increasing digitization and online transactions, it becomes ever so important for the credit card companies 
to be able to recognize "genuine" and "fraudulent" transactions in order to provide their customers with a more secure
and a seamless experience. 


## Requirements:
1. Detect fraudulent transactions at the shortest possible time (Since the transactions are happening in real time, 
timing constraints play a very important role). Whenever a card member swipes his/her card for payment, the transaction 
should be classified as fraudulent /authentic based on a set of predefined rules. 

2. To resolve the customer complaints and queries, the support team should be made available with the latest customer details (by constantly keeping them updated).


## Solution
 We need to Architect and design the solution to meet the above requirement and to solve the problem using Big Data Technologies.
 
## Technologies used to derive the solution.
1. Sqoop for ingesting the data
2. Kafka for handling the streaming data
3. Hive-Hbase for creating the tables
4. Spark -(Batch and Stream) Data processing
5. Airflow for scheduling
